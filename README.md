Advanced Computer Vision: Volume Control by Manual Gesture.

Principal: VolumeHandControl.py / Module: HandTracking.py

A complete hand-tracking and a gesture volume control were implemented based in OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries. The logarithmic nature of the sound is considered and properly implemented.

Hand-tracking was implemented based in OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries. In addition to the detection and tracking of hands, gesture volume control is included (where the pycaw library is used). Functions to properly convert volume values between logarithmic and linear scales are also used.
 
Two exit conditions are presented, pointing to a specific place on the video screen and pressing a key.
